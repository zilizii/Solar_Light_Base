#  Solar Light Base Project  

The base created due to the faulty molded Solar light bases.  

##  What I learned  

OpenSCAD is a powerful tool to create 3D models more programatically way. Free to use, easy to create simple things.

## Hints  

Due to inaccuracy to pressure fit the base with the Solar Light I used a dremmel tool to sanding out some part of the teeths...  

Please enjoy the learning !!!   
Keep Smiling!!!
